# Social Data Analysis Platform
Currently crunching twitter data and transforming that to several categories and using a web platform to show the data to the world. 

It's inspired by COVID-19, but can be used for any trending topic's dashboard


## Implementation Plan:

* Build PySpark Streaming app using NLTK for categorizing tweets
* Saving data on to Mongo Database
Visualization of the Data on DB using a web platform
* Implement a user login based platform where users could request for additional twitter tags from which we need to pull data.
* Generate statistics based on the above data.
* Will visualize statistics in the later phase into a dashboard like this

# Web Platform Technologies considered:
* Django based API Implementation.
